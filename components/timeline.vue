And soon, a large-scale destructive war, also known as the "core system replacement," is scheduled to unfold. You can usually find me making difficult faces at my monitor, muttering to myself while pacing, or fueled by Monster Energy, occasionally prodding some code. It\'s a glamorous life.',

    content: 'Became part of a shadowy cabal of engineers in May 2024. Our agenda? Delving into AI, attempting to build our own (hopefully not too sentient) LLMs, swapping war stories about the latest web tech and those ever-so-stable core systems, and occasionally making things go "boom" with embedded systems and soldering irons. So far, property damage has been minimal.',

    content: 'Ah, the SES epoch. Vaguely recall hammering out some web apps with Go. Then there was that fun time deciphering ancient CakePHP scrolls â€“ "reverse-engineering," they called it. Pretty sure I sacrificed a few brain cells in those trenches and barely escaped the legendary SES meat grinder. Good times? Debatable.',

Rumor has it they actually deployed it, which is frankly terrifying. I was mainly there for the free coffee and perfecting the art of looking busy.',

It was, technically speaking, employment. My key performance indicator was Monster Energy consumption, which, fun fact, led to a delightful liver ailment.',

Tinkered with making sound waves look cool (audio spectral analysis), taught computers to play peek-a-boo (machine learning for image recognition), and haphazardly assembled some web apps with Spring, Laravel, and C#.Net, mostly because I could. Entered a few coding contests, mostly for the snacks. My win rate was impressively zero. But hey, I showed up!',
